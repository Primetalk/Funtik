# Funtik

Funtik is a home navigation system.

The idea is to have a wheel robotic platform that can walk around a flat/office and take/bring things to/from rooms. The robot should be able to maintain the map of a flat and understand high level navigation tasks. For instance, "bring me the red ball from my room". Given this task the robot should be able to drive to the room, find the ball and return back, overcoming obstacles.

This robotic system might be constructed using Scala/Dotty and SynapseGrid.
